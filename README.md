Hi! I’m @yujinak👋 
Also called Yuji.
Born and raised in Curitiba, Capital of Paraná State, Brazil.

In 2017, I graduated in Architecture and Urbanism at PUCPR (Brazil).
But since 2023, I'm transitioning my carrer to the Tech field!
More specifically, to the Web Development Area 👉🏽👨🏽‍💻

That's why you can see some projects in JavaScript, HTML & CSS!
But also, other ones made in Java and other languages😉

I'm looking for my first job in this field, so if we can collaborate, please reach me!
